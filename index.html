    <div class="aboutme">
      <p>
        I am currently a second year student in Graphic Design at Algonquin College
        in Canada's beautiful capitol city, Ottawa.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family is my fantastic and
        talented husband, Ben, who is a dedicated sound engineer. We
        recently got married in Belize after being together for 11 amazing years.
        I've got a two-year-old boston terrier called Atlas and a cat named Marley who is five.
        I love reading and collecting comic books, playing video games, and going to conventions like Comicon.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ideal career would be working as an illustrator in a graphic design studio
        here in Ottawa.  My work is strongest in illustrating, painting and drawing
        but I am also skilled with page layouts, logos, infographics, and print design.
        I'm skilled with Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign.
