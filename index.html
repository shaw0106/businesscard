        I am currently a second year student in Graphic Design at Algonquin College
        in Canada's beautiful capitol city, Ottawa. My family is my fantastic and
        talented husband, Ben, who is a dedicated sound engineer. Although we have
        only recently gotten married we have been together for 11 sweet kick-ass years.
        I've got a two year-old boston terrier called Atlas and a cat named Marley.

        My ideal career would be working as an illustrator in a graphic design studio
        here in ottawa.  My work is strongest in illustrating, painting and drawing
        but I am also skilled with page layouts, logos, infographics, and print design.
