    <div class="aboutme">
      <p>
        I am currently a second year student in Graphic Design at Algonquin College
        in Canada's beautiful capitol city, Ottawa, Canada.
        <br><br>
        My family is my fantastic and
        talented husband, Ben, who is a dedicated sound engineer. Although we
        only recently got married we have been together for 11 amazing years and were highschool sweet hearts.
        I've got a two year-old boston terrier called Atlas and a cat named Marley who is five.
        <br><br>
        My ideal career would be working as an illustrator in a graphic design studio
        here in Ottawa.  My work is strongest in illustrating, painting and drawing
        but I am also skilled with page layouts, logos, infographics, and print design.
